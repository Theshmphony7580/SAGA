# 🧠 AI-Powered Data Analytics Assistant

Welcome to the developer documentation for **AI Data Analytics Assistant** — a full-stack AI platform that ingests, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes datasets through machine learning and LLM-driven intelligence.

## Core Architecture
- **Backend (FastAPI)** — API orchestration layer
- **ML Engine** — Profiling, cleaning, insights
- **NLQ Engine (LLM)** — Natural language → Pandas code
- **Sandbox** — Safe code execution
- **Visualization & Reporting** — Charts and exports
- **Frontend** — Streamlit/React UI

### Core Principles
- All cleaning is **ML-driven**, not rule-based.
- Modular, replaceable components.
- Transparent, explainable transformations.
- Secure sandboxing and observability.
